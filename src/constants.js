    question: 'What is yield farming?',
    answer: (
      <>
        Yield farming is the practice of putting your crypto assets to work via staking or lending
        to generate returns and earn rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency. This process
        can be done manually by anyone in DeFi or automated via platforms such as Harvest that
        maximize your returns with the latest yield strategies & auto-compounding mechanism.

          <li style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
            Yield farming is a highly manual process and inconvenient for people that cannot keep up
            with the latest updates 24/7. Harvest automates the yield farming process by regularly
            harvesting & auto-compounding rewards at a significantly lower cost for users.

        Harvest does not charge you any deposit/withdrawal fee. There is only a performance fee

        While FARM emissions start accruing immediately after depositing, yields from farmed tokens
        come after a successful DoHardWork (a smart contract execution). Profitability analysis is

        Harvest’s flagship farm is called ‘Profit-Sharing’. It’s where anyone can deposit the native
        $FARM, $iFARM, or any other token deposited via Wido to be entitled to a part of the yield
        from all other farming strategies at Harvest.

          <li>Governance decisions of the underlying platform</li>

        Harvest is an international cooperative of users pooling resources to earn DeFi yields. When

        Wido is a 3rd party zap provider which Harvest uses under the hood. With Wido, users can
        deposit any token into any farm, for example, $USDC into an $ETH farm. Wido takes care of

    question: 'Why do I need to Deposit and then additionally Stake my tokens?',
    answer: (

        The first step to getting started farming with Harvest is to wrap your token into Harvest’s
        f_Token, such as fUSDC. From here, you can 1) use it for farming on Harvest to be entitled
        to all rewards, 2) take it to another DeFi platform for yield derivatives, interest rates,
        or use as collateral.
        <br />

        Staking your fToken on Harvest only then entitles you to full APY of the given farm.

        Interacting with our farms, whether depositing or withdrawing, comes with network fees.
        Depending on network congestion, the fees can be temporarily higher than usual. We suggest
        coming back later for lower fees​. (Tip: Sundays are usually low in network activity

        Withdrawing is a two-step process. First, you need to unstake your fToken from Harvest.

    question: 'What is the utility of FARM token?',
    answer: (
      <>
        FARM fuels the Harvest platform. It is simultaneously a reward token for users, a payment
        token for Harvest workers, and a governance token. Its supply is limited to 690,420 tokens.
        FARM is also a cash flow token for Harvest. When Harvest’s farms generate yields, 70% (70%
        on Ethereum Network, 92% on other chains) of these yields are used to increase the value of
        the deposits. The remaining 30% (30% on Ethereum Network, 8% on other chains) are converted
        into FARM tokens which are then used to reward farmers who staked their FARM into the FARM
        pool on Ethereum Network. Hence the name ‘Profit-Sharing.’
        <br />
        <br />
        The Profit-Sharing pool has implications for the value of iFARM - the yield-bearing FARM.
        iFARM is using the FARM pool under the hood. iFARM acts as FARM staked in the Profit-Sharing
        pool. Its main advantages are 1) a lower gas cost, 2) transferability and 3) further new
        utilities (e.g. lending collateralization).

    question: 'APR / APY Disclaimer',
    answer: (
      <div>
        The stated APR/APY (the &apos;Rate&apos;) is denominated in terms of relevant underlying
        tokens in the vaults. The Rate is a forward-looking projection based on our good faith
        belief of how to project results over the relevant period reasonably, but such belief is
        subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties (including smart contract security
        risks and third-party actions) which could result in a materially different (lower or
        higher) token-denominated APR/APY. The Rate is not a promise, guarantee, or undertaking on
        the part of any person or group of persons but depends entirely on the results of the
        operation of smart contracts and other autonomous systems (including third-party systems)
        and how third parties interact with those systems after the time of your deposit. Even if
        the Rate is achieved as projected, you may still suffer a financial loss in fiat-denominated
        terms if the fiat-denominated value of the relevant tokens (your deposit and any tokens
        allocated or distributed to you pursuant to the Rate) declines during the deposit period.
